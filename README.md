# R code from my University of Aberdeen master's thesis on the mixed fisheries industry in Scotland.
This code was the result of four months of work analyzing bycatch rates in the mixed fisheries industry in Scotland. The data analyzed was provided by Marine Scotland Science and Dr. Harriet Cole. Early parts of the code were not used in the final analysis, but were kept to show my process of analysis over the entire course of the project.
